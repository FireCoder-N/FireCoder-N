### 💻 About Me
I'm a tech-loving undergraduate Electrical & Computer Engineering student (23M) with a broad spectrum of interests. Whether it's AI, machine learning, game/web dev , animating, computer vision, electronics tinkering building my homelab or exploring cybersecurity challenges, I tend to bounce from one passion to the next, always eager to learn more.

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Play With:
- **Languages**: Python, C++ (plus some dips into many more, thanks to uni 🧠)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, NiceGUI, OpenCV and more
- **Tools & IDEs**: VS Code *(for the win ✌)*, Unreal Engine, Blender  
- **Other Technologies**: Docker, Arduino, HackTheBox, TryHackMe

### 🕹️ When I'm Not Coding:
**I might be reading 📚, DIY crafting/tinkering 🎨, (D&D) worldbuilding 🗺, or playing 🎲/🎮.**

Yeah, it’s a pretty packed schedule, but that’s how I like it! If it's creative, technical, or requires a touch of imagination and/or critical thinking, I’m there.

### 🔍 Fun (and weird) Facts:
- 🧠 Logic and puzzles are my jam — call me a *logician* in disguise. 
- 🐲 I geek out over D&D, (puzzle) games, and other stuff.
- ⚙ AI, cybersecurity, game dev, and web dev, electronics, animation? I want it *all*.
- 🎂 My birthday is on 21/7.
- 🎓 I love constantly learning, exploring and experimenting.
